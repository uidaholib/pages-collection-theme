# About {{ site.title }}

This is a demo digital collection produced by researchers in the [Palouse Digital Scholarship Symposium](https://palousedh.github.io/symposium/) 2018.
Participants scanned and described physical items.
The digital objects and metadata were loaded into `pages-collection` project to create this site. 
The metadata drives the Jekyll based project, built and hosted on GitHub Pages.
